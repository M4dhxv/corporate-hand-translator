## [6.0.0] — 2026-02-28

### 🔷 Full TypeScript Migration + Engineering Overhaul

Complete rewrite of the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript with strict mode. Added centralized configuration, automated testing, error recovery, code splitting, and comprehensive viva documentation.

#### TypeScript Migration
- ✅ All 13 source files converted from `.js/.jsx` to `.ts/.tsx`
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` with `strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`
- ✅ Zero type errors (`tsc --noEmit` passes cleanly)
- ✅ `src/types/index.ts` — 14 shared interfaces (Landmark, MLPrediction, GestureResult, etc.)
- ✅ `src/types/mediapipe.d.ts` — CDN global type declarations for `window.Hands` and `window.Camera`
- ✅ `src/vite-env.d.ts` — Vite client type reference
- ✅ `GestureLabel` union type via `as const` for compile-time label safety

#### Architecture Cleanup
- ✅ **Single source of truth**: `src/config/gestureConfig.ts` — all labels, phrases, thresholds, UI mappings
- ✅ **Dead code removed**: deleted `src/utils/gestureClassifier.js` (legacy rule-based classifier)
- ✅ **State consolidation**: Unified voice state with `useRef` sync to prevent stale closures
- ✅ **Module structure**: 4-layer architecture (Config → ML → Hooks → UI) with zero circular dependencies

#### Performance & Resilience
- ✅ **Code splitting**: TensorFlow.js lazy-loaded via `import()` — initial bundle 21KB
- ✅ **React.lazy**: TrainingMode component lazy-loaded with Suspense fallback
- ✅ **CDN resilience**: MediaPipe loaded with 15-second timeout + 2 automatic retries
- ✅ **ErrorBoundary**: Catches runtime crashes (camera denied, CDN failure, WebGL missing) with retry UI
- ✅ **Pinch detector fix**: Migrated from pixel coordinates to normalized coordinates (0-1 range)

#### Testing & Evaluation
- ✅ 32 automated unit tests (`tests/gestureDecisionEngine.test.mjs`)
  - Stability voting, thumb dominance gating, cooldown enforcement/expiry
  - Hand disappearance reset, NONE prediction rejection, mixed frame instability
  - Same gesture deduplication, phrase/gestureType correctness for all 5 classes
- ✅ Model evaluation script (`scripts/evaluateModel.mjs`)
  - Synthetic landmark generation, confusion matrix, per-class precision/recall/F1

#### Documentation
- ✅ `VIVA_PREP.md` — 1020-line viva preparation document
  - 95 Q&As across 14 sections
  - Project-specific, ML theory, React/TypeScript, SDLC, DFD, ER diagrams
  - Data structures & algorithms, OS concepts, networking, security
  - UML diagrams (use case, class, sequence), board-ready diagrams
  - Demo script, glossary, numbers to memorize

#### Files Added
- `src/config/gestureConfig.ts` — centralized configuration
- `src/types/index.ts` — shared TypeScript interfaces

## [5.1.0] — 2026-02-16

### 🎯 Improved Gesture Detection

#### Fixed
- **Open Palm vs Pointing Confusion**: Fixed issue where open palm gestures were incorrectly detected as pointing gestures
    - Lowered ML confidence threshold from 0.65 to 0.60 for better sensitivity
    - Added intelligent heuristic logic to distinguish between similar gestures
    - When model confidence is ambiguous (within 0.15), counts extended fingers to determine correct gesture
    - If 3+ fingers are extended, correctly classifies as open palm instead of pointing

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

#### Changed
- **Control Button Placement**: Moved voice and personalization toggles to top-right of video feed
- **Gesture Legend**: Added gesture options overlay at bottom of video feed
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Video feed is now the clear focal point

#### Technical Details
- Modified `src/ml/gestureModel.js` — Enhanced `predictGesture()` with finger counting heuristic
- Modified `src/App.jsx` — Restructured UI with video overlays for controls and gesture legend

## [4.3.0] — 2026-02-15

### 🔘 Button Toggle Restored for Voice Control

Rolled back from pinch gesture to traditional button toggle for voice control. Pinch gesture proved unreliable in production despite strict refinement (v4.2.0).

#### Changes
- ✅ Removed pinch gesture detection (`src/hooks/usePinchDetector.js` no longer imported)
- ✅ Added voice toggle button to Settings panel
- ✅ Button shows ON/OFF status with color indicators (green for ON, gray for OFF)
- ✅ Cleaner status bar (removed "pinch to toggle" instruction)
- ✅ Simplified voice control UX

#### Files Modified
- `src/App.jsx` – Removed usePinchDetector import, removed pinch initialization, removed pinch detection from gesture handler, added voice toggle button to settings
- `package.json` – Version bumped to 4.3.0

#### Lesson Learned
While pinch gesture detection worked technically (v4.1.0 → v4.2.0), real-world hand movement variation caused false positives even with strict multi-condition validation. Simple button toggle provides more reliable user experience with fewer unintended activations.

#### Voice Control Behavior
- Voice toggle button in Settings panel shows current state
- User can click button to enable/disable TTS for gesture announcements
- State persists during session
- Independent from gesture recognition system

## [4.2.0] — 2026-02-15

### 🎯 Pinch Gesture Detection Refinement

**Strict pinch detection to eliminate false positives**. Pinch gesture now requires ALL conditions to be met before triggering voice toggle.

```#### Enhanced Detection Logic

**Strict Criteria (All Must Be True):**
1. **Thumb + Index Pinch**: Distance < 40px (very tight threshold)
2. **Fingers CLOSED**: Middle, Ring, and Pinky tips must be closer to wrist than their joints
   - If any of these three fingers are extended → pinch is invalid
3. **Index NOT Fully Extended**: Prevents conflict with POINTING_UP gesture
4. **Gesture Dominance**: Pinch suppressed if PEACE, POINTING_UP, or OPEN_PALM active
5. **Hold Time**: 700-900ms continuous (immediately resets if any condition breaks)
6. **Cooldown**: 2-second lock after successful toggle (prevents spam)

#### Technical Details
- Distance calculation: Euclidean distance between landmarks 4 (thumb tip) and 8 (index tip)
- Finger extension: Tip distance from wrist > 1.15 × PIP distance from wrist
- Index extension check: Tip distance > 150px from wrist AND tip Y < PIP Y - 30px
- Conflicting gestures: PEACE_SIGN, POINTING_UP, OPEN_PALM suppress pinch detection

#### User Impact
- ✅ Fewer accidental toggles from casual hand movements
- ✅ Clear intentional gesture required (pinch + hold other fingers closed)
- ✅ No interference with other gestures
- ✅ Consistent, predictable behavior

#### Files Modified
- `src/hooks/usePinchDetector.js` – Complete rewrite with strict logic
- `src/App.jsx` – Pass currentGestureType to pinch detector

## [3.2.0] — 2026-02-15

### ✨ Added - Gesture Decision Engine

**Major usability improvement**: Fixed real-world gesture confusion and jitter problems without retraining the ML model.

Introduces `gestureDecisionEngine.js` — a deterministic, frame-by-frame decision layer that sits between raw ML predictions and UI triggers. This hardens the gesture recognition system for real-world use.

#### What was fixed:

- **Gesture Confusion (CLOSED_FIST ↔ THUMBS_UP)**
    - Implemented **Thumb Dominance Gate**: THUMBS_UP now requires the thumb to be significantly more extended than all other fingers
    - If thumb is not dominant, the gesture is reclassified as CLOSED_FIST
    - Eliminates false THUMBS_UP when fist has thumb slightly peeking out
    - Threshold: 1.3× (configurable) — thumb distance must be 30% greater than max other finger distance

- **Frame-to-Frame Jitter**
    - Implemented **Stability Voting**: Requires 8 consecutive frames of the same gesture before accepting it
    - Small camera jitter that flip-flops between gestures no longer triggers repeated TTS
    - Smooth, natural interaction that feels intentional

- **Gesture Spam / Repeated TTS**
    - Implemented **Intent Lock with Cooldown**: Once a gesture is accepted, it's locked for 2.5 seconds
    - During cooldown, all new gesture predictions are silently ignored
    - Prevents re-triggering the same corporate phrase when hand jitters
    - Cooldown resets when hand disappears
    - Configurable: `GESTURE_COOLDOWN_MS` (default 2500)

- **Conservative Tie-Breaking** (forward-compatible)
    - Code structure ready for confidence-aware tie-breaking
    - When two gestures have similar confidence, conservative gestures win
    - Example: THUMBS_UP (75% confidence) vs CLOSED_FIST (68% confidence) → prefer CLOSED_FIST if margin < 10%
    - Ranking: OPEN_PALM > POINTING_UP > PEACE_SIGN > CLOSED_FIST > THUMBS_UP

#### New Files:
- `src/ml/gestureDecisionEngine.js` — Core decision logic with all gates and voting

#### Modified Files:
- `src/ml/gestureModel.js` — Now exposes full probability distribution for tie-breaking
- `src/hooks/useHandTracking.js` — Integrated decision engine into frame processing pipeline

#### Code Quality:
- **Fully documented**: Each gate has explicit comments explaining the WHY
- **Debuggable**: `getEngineState()` API for inspecting decision state frame-by-frame
- **Testable**: Pure functions with explicit geometry checks (no hidden heuristics)
- **Zero-cost**: No additional ML, no API calls, 100% browser-side

#### Configuration (in `gestureDecisionEngine.js`):
```javascript
STABILITY_FRAMES = 8              // Frames required to stabilize
GESTURE_COOLDOWN_MS = 2500        // Cooldown after acceptance (ms)
THUMB_DOMINANCE_THRESHOLD = 1.3   // Thumb distance factor (higher = stricter)
CONFIDENCE_TIE_BREAK_THRESHOLD = 0.1  // Confidence margin for tie-breaking
```

## [3.1.2] — 2026-02-15

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Text-to-Speech Reliability**: Improved TTS initialization and voice loading across all browsers.
    - Fixed voice event listener using proper `addEventListener()` instead of property assignment to avoid handler conflicts.
    - Added fallback voice loading in `speakPhrase()` to handle timing issues when voices haven't loaded from state.
    - Wrapped TTS priming in try-catch with promise error handling for safer initialization.
    - Enhanced error logging to show specific error types instead of full error objects.
    - Added proper cleanup of voice change event listeners to prevent memory leaks.
    - Added `onstart` and `onend` callbacks for better speech lifecycle tracking.

---

## [3.1.1] — 2026-02-10

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Deployment TTS Failure**: Fixed an issue where Text-to-Speech would fail in production or on new devices due to uninitialized voices or strict browser autoplay policies.
    - Added explicit **voice loading** handling for Chrome/Chromium (`onvoiceschanged`).
    - Added **TTS engine priming**: Clicking "Voice On" now triggers a silent utterance to unlock the audio context.

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-02-10

### 🐛 Fixed
- **TTS Silence/Stuttering**: Implemented a 500ms stability filter (throttle) in `App.jsx` to prevent gesture flickering from rapidly canceling speech. Text-to-speech now speaks smoothly even if detection jitters.
- **Console Noise**: Removed verbose TTS debugging logs from production code.
